Installation
------------

* To install cuda, wine must be removed due to conflicting opencl files.
* Because of an update to OpenGLRaw, we need to limit OpenGLRaw < 2.0. As of 7/15 this may no longer be true.
* Possibly due to a cuda installer bug, you need to manually run
    sudo ldconfig /usr/local/cuda/lib[64]
* Don't forget to follow the nvidia post-install instructions! Namely, 
  add /usr/local/cuda/bin to the PATH in order to get nvcc.
